# Machine Translation Model(converting textual data from english to french language)


Dataset used - French English Bilingual pair dataset from kaggle.
This dataset contains pairs of French sentences as well as their english translation.

Neural Machine Translation:
                          One of the earliest goals for computers was the automatic translation of text from 
one language to another.Automatic or machine translation is perhaps one of the most challenging artificial 
intelligence tasks given the fluidity of human language. Classically, rule-based systems were used for this
task, which were replaced in the 1990s with statistical methods. More recently, deep neural network models 
achieve state-of-the-art results in a field that is aptly named neural machine translation.

The main benefit of NMT is that a single system can be trained sdirectly on a sorce of text larger
no longer requiring the pipeline of specialized systems used in statistical machine learning.

The models used for neural machine translation are:
1)Simple model
2)Embedding model
3)Encoder decoder model
4)Bidirectional model
5)Final model
But the best translation was with final model.
